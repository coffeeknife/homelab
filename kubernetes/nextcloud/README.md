# Nextcloud deployment
Nextcloud can't be fully configured from the helm chart and requires manual intervention to complete setup.

- **Collabora:** Nextcloud Office must be installed from the app store and the url must be set to `https://docs.wrenspace.dev/`.
- **NFS:** Enable External Storage on the "My Apps" page.
